def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

    This function uses a simple recursive approach to calculate the factorial
    of a given non-negative integer. Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the
    product of all positive integers less than or equal to n (denoted as n!).
    Factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

    Args:
        n (int): The non-negative integer for which the factorial is to be calculated.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is a negative integer.

    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

        return n * factorial(n - 1)


# Example usage:
try:
    num = 5
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
